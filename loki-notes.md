# Logging System on K8S

## install

currently stuck at `tk show environments/loki` on [loki install doc](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/installation/tanka/)

it seems that there's a [newer version of document](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/next/installation/tanka/) (but marked as next)

based on this doc, we need to config object storage backend
